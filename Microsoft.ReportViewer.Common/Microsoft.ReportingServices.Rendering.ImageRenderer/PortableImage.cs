	/// real GDI+ Image (unchanged behavior). On non-Windows it decodes via the

	/// handling (docs/rendering-abstractions.md), giving Width/Height/resolution
	/// without needing GDI+ at all. Actually drawing this onto a page surface still
	/// requires a non-Windows raster surface, which does not exist yet - see
	/// tasks/image-renderer-cross-platform.md's Phase 2. This type only covers
	/// decode/metadata (Phase 1); IsGdiBacked is false on non-Windows and callers
	/// must skip the actual draw call until Phase 2 lands.
