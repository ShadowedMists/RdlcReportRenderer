# TODO

## Project Status Summary

Infrastructure complete. Excel Phases 4-5 complete. **Chart engine's GDI+→interface abstraction is now fully done**, including the construction-time crash chase discovered 2026-07-28 (Chart/Gauge model objects couldn't even be constructed on Linux at all): all three GDI+ construction walls (Font, GraphicsPath/HotRegionsList, StringFormat) are fixed and their full caller-migration sweeps are complete, WSL-verified with a real rendered PNG (a Sunburst chart with a Legend, nested rings, and per-node labels — not just a simple bar chart). **Word and IMAGE (JPEG/PNG/BMP) renderers are fully cross-platform now too** (TIFF/EMF remain permanently Windows-only, no portable equivalent). Gauge engine GDI+→interface abstraction is complete (no Skia backend yet — not started, low priority). PDF cross-platform rendering is complete. **Map engine is mid-migration**: Milestone A (interface + adapters) is done, Milestone B (real call-site conversion) is at 10 of ~20 painter files; separately, a real functional-correctness bug (not a cross-platform gap) was found and partially fixed — RDL-defined Map layers never actually populated any spatial elements at all, on any platform, until a 2026-07-31 fix for the static/embedded-point case. Full detail on all of these lives in `docs/`, not here — see the Documentation index below.

### Current Priorities

| Priority | Phase | Status | Risk |
|----------|-------|--------|------|
| 🔴 **HIGH** | Excel Phase 4: ImageFormatType Enum | ✅ COMPLETE | LOW |
| 🔴 **HIGH** | Excel Phase 5: IImageProvider Abstraction | ✅ COMPLETE | MEDIUM |
| 🟡 **HIGH** | Chart engine: GDI+ → interface abstraction | ✅ COMPLETE (2026-07-30) — Font, HotRegionsList/GraphicsPath, and StringFormat sweeps all finished; WSL-verified a real complex chart (Sunburst) renders correctly on Linux; see `docs/rendering-abstractions.md`, `docs/platform-support.md` | LOW |
| 🟡 **HIGH** | Gauge engine: GDI+ → interface abstraction | ✅ COMPLETE (no Skia backend — not started, low priority) | HIGH |
| 🔴 **HIGH** | Chart/Gauge: model classes' default Font crashed Linux at *construction* time (not just rendering) | ✅ DONE (2026-07-31) — full chase complete, see `tasks/chart-default-font-cross-platform.md` | LOW |
| 🔴 **HIGH** | Chart: `HotRegionsList`/`HotRegion` constructed raw `System.Drawing.Drawing2D.GraphicsPath` for tooltip hit-testing | ✅ DONE — internals and the ~30-file caller migration both complete; see `tasks/chart-hotregion-graphicspath-cross-platform.md` | LOW |
| 🟢 **MEDIUM** | Chart: `Label.Paint`/`Paint3D` constructed raw `System.Drawing.StringFormat` directly | ✅ DONE (2026-07-30) — `Label.cs` plus the full ~19-file/~64-site sweep complete; only the documented `SmartLabels`/`GetLabelPosition` permanent boundaries remain concrete, by design; see `tasks/chart-stringformat-cross-platform.md` | LOW |
| 🔵 **LOW** | PDF: cross-platform rendering | ✅ COMPLETE — see `docs/platform-support.md`'s "PDF (RDL engine)" section | LOW |
| 🔵 **LOW** | WebRequest → HttpClient migration (SYSLIB0014) | ✅ DONE except 3 Map-engine sites, deliberately deferred with the rest of the Map engine; see `tasks/webrequest-httpclient-migration.md` | LOW |
| 🔵 **LOW** | XmlValidatingReader → XmlReader migration (CS0618) | ✅ DONE (2026-07-27); see `docs/decisions.md`'s `RDLValidatingReader` entry | LOW |
| 🟡 **HIGH** | Map engine: GDI+ → interface abstraction | 🔄 Milestone A done (2026-07-28); Milestone B at 10 of ~20 painter files (2026-07-31) — remaining files are blocked on one of three now-documented permanent-boundary patterns (`DrawPathAbs` shared-mutable-field entanglement, gradient-brush `.Transform` manipulation, or missing `MapGraphics`-only interface overloads), not a plain file-at-a-time sweep; Milestones C (render-surface abstraction)/D (Skia backend)/E (EMF guard) not started; see `tasks/map-engine-cross-platform.md` | HIGH |
| 🔴 **HIGH** | Map engine: spatial-element population was a no-op (functional bug, all platforms) | 🔄 Static/embedded-point case fixed and verified end-to-end (2026-07-31, incl. 5 unrelated pre-existing `NullReferenceException` bugs found and fixed along the way, plus a real color-scale-legend rendering bug); dataset-bound population (`SpatialDataSetMapper.ProcessRow`) and line/polygon WKT geometry remain unimplemented; see `tasks/map-spatial-data-population-gap.md` | HIGH |
| 🔵 **LOW** | Remaining CS0649 dead-field warnings (~52 tracked + ~16 found later) | ✅ DONE (2026-07-30); see `tasks/remaining-warning-cleanup.md` | LOW |
| 🔵 **LOW** | Word (WORD/WORDOPENXML) renderer: cross-platform support | ✅ DONE (2026-07-30) — both the image-decode gap and the WORD-binary CFBF-writer gap are fixed and WSL-verified; see `tasks/word-renderer-cross-platform.md` | LOW |
| 🔵 **LOW** | IMAGE (TIFF/EMF) renderer: cross-platform support | ✅ DONE (2026-07-31) for BMP/JPEG/PNG, including Chart/Gauge/Map embedding, WSL-verified with a real rendered PNG; TIFF/EMF remain permanently Windows-only (no portable equivalent); see `tasks/image-renderer-cross-platform.md` | LOW |
| 🔵 **LOW** | RDL expression compiler: sandboxing + single-file deployment | ✅ Sandboxing documented as permanent limitation; single-file deployment fixed and verified end-to-end (2026-07-27, published-single-file harness); see `tasks/expression-compiler-modernization.md` | LOW |
| 🔵 **LOW** | Test coverage: HTML/CSV/XML/WORD/IMAGE/Gauge/Map have none | ✅ DONE (2026-07-31) — HTML/CSV/XML/WORD/Gauge/IMAGE(TIFF/BMP)/Map all have smoke-test coverage; Map additionally now has a color-scale-legend fixture proven to render correctly (not just non-crashing); see `tasks/test-coverage-gaps.md` | LOW |

### Long-Term Vision

The architecture should support Windows, Linux, and macOS rendering, third-party rendering engines, and future rendering technologies — the rendering system should become a platform rather than a collection of built-in renderers. See `AGENTS.md`'s Mission statement for the one-line version; this file (not AGENTS.md) tracks how close each renderer actually is to that goal.

## Documentation index

- `docs/rendering-abstractions.md` — Excel/PDF renderer factory design + Chart/Gauge Ports & Adapters architecture (interfaces, namespaces, recurring patterns)
- `docs/platform-support.md` — current Windows/Linux/macOS support matrix and known gaps (Map's remaining migration, PDF)

## Notes

- Update this file's status table as milestones complete; keep any still-open scope in the linked `tasks/*.md` files, not here.
- Durable architecture facts, decisions, and known gaps belong in `docs/`, not in task-tracking narrative.
- Once a `tasks/*.md` file's work is complete, migrate anything durable into `docs/` and delete the file — don't leave a completed migration's narrative log behind as a duplicate record.
